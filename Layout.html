            <h2>Population distribution of Australian capital cities in 2021</h2>
            <p>As the Australian real estate market continues to evolve, it becomes particularly
                important to
                understand its
                historical trends and current conditions. This visualization aims to shed light on house price
                changes
                in
                Australia, and <span class='Melbourne'>Melbourne</span> in particular, over the past decade, and the
                demographic and geographic factors
                associated with them. By analyzing population distribution, house price trends, house type share and
                geographic
                location together, investors, real estate developers and ordinary consumers can make decisions and
                strategies
                with greater clarity.</p>

                <p class="right-p">According to the map it can be seen that the state with the highest population is
                    <span class='New_south_wales'>New south Wales</span> followed by <span
                        class='Victoria'>Victoria</span>.
                    The majority of the population is located along the south
                    east coast
                    of Australia. The capital cities
                    of these two states are <span class='Sydney'>Sydney</span> and <span
                        class='Melbourne'>Melbourne</span>
                    respectively. Therefore, based on the map of population
                    distribution it is concluded that the demand for housing is higher in the cities of <span

                    2011-2021. As you
                    can see from the graph, most of the cities show significant price increases. <span
                        class='Sydney'>Sydney</span>
                    and <span class='Melbourne'> Melbourne </span> have seen
                    particularly significant house price growth. <span class='Sydney'>Sydney</span>, which is number one
                    in

                    the fastest growing house prices. Population number two <span class='Melbourne'>Melbourne</span> in
                    <span class='Victoria'>Victoria</span> is a close second. This suggests
                    that property prices are likely to follow suit and continue to rise. This is because the <span
                        class='Sydney'>Sydney</span> house price
                    market is likely to be saturated. However <span class='Melbourne'>Melbourne</span> has the potential
                    to
                    continue to rise. Therefore it makes
                    more sense to analyze the <span class='Melbourne'>Melbourne</span> house price market.

                        (within about 50 km) are the most densely populated. As the distance increases, especially after
                        250km, the population decreases significantly. This suggests that most people tend to live in or
                        near the city center, probably because of the amenities, work and ease of living there. Areas
                        away from city centers, on the other hand, are less populated, possibly because of their
                        remoteness or more limited resources.

                        graph, prices are relatively high
                        in areas closer to the city center (within about 50 km), especially in the areas closest to the
                        city center. However, when the distance exceeds 50 kilometers, prices start to gradually
                        decline. After 250 kilometers, house prices do not change much and remain at a relatively low
                        level. This may indicate that there is a higher demand for homes in the city center and its
                        immediate suburbs, leading to higher prices, while areas away from the city center, due to
                        remoteness or other factors, have relatively low and stable house prices.</p>

                        population
                        show a

                        relatively
                        slow rate
                        and in some places show a stabilizing or slightly increasing trend. <span

                        prices.
                        In areas
                        away from the city center, the supply and demand for housing is relatively balanced due to a
                        smaller
                        population,
                        resulting in relatively stable prices.</p>

                <div id="line_chart2"></div>
                <p class="right-p1">The homeownership rate is 67% in 2021, down from 70% in 2006. Beginning in 1971,
                    homeownership rates

                    younger
                    age groups such as 30-34 and 25-29 declined significantly. At the same time, homeownership rates for
                    earlier
                    birth cohorts, such as 1947-1951, have trended upward over their lifetimes. However, more recent
                    birth
                    cohorts
                    generally have lower homeownership rates compared to birth cohorts from earlier eras. This reflects
                    differences
                    in homeownership between age and birth cohorts. Continuous birth cohorts have consistently lower
                    homeownership

                    buying or
